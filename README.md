# Bingo
(Fall 2019)<br><br>As the first project of my Computer Science journey, the purpose of this project was to create a working game of bingo. A 2D array of unique randomly generated integers would be filled and as the user plays, each randomly called integer would be placed with an X should it appear on the board. Should there be five X's in a row, the player has bingo and thus they win.<br><br>The assignment only asked for horizontal bingo, but I may go back and modify the code to additionally account for vertical and diagonal bingos.
